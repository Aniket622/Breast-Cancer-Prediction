# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to predict whether a breast tumor is **Malignant** or **Benign** based on diagnostic features.  
It demonstrates an **end-to-end data science workflow**, including data exploration, preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

This project is ideal for showcasing **data analysis, machine learning, and model evaluation skills**.
